# radixSort
This code reads a number of floating point numbers from the user, and then sorts them using a radix sort algorithm that is tweaked for floating point numbers. Finally it prints the sorted float numbers. Here is how it works:

main() function:
This function reads in an integer count from the user which represents the number of floating point numbers that will be entered. It then allocates an array of floats of size "count". After that, it loops "count" times to read floating point numbers from standard input, storing them in the array "arr". Then it calls the "radix_sort(arr, count);" function, passing the array of input floats and its length. After sorting, it loops through the now sorted "arr" array, printing each float to the standard output with two decimal places precision. Once all elements are printed, it frees the memory allocated to the "arr" array.

radix_sort(float* arr, int n) function:
This function implements the radix sort algorithm, but makes it sort floating point numbers. It first allocates memory for a buffer array and two sets of bucket pointers for use in the sorting process. It then uses a union of a float and a 32-bit unsigned integer to manipulate the bit representation of each float. By finding the maximum "FloatInt" union and calculating the number of iterations needed, it performs the sorting process. For each bit from least significant to most significant, it places each number into a bucket according to its bit value at that position, then refills the array from the buckets. After sorting the numbers by each bit, it frees the memory allocated for the buffer and buckets. The sorting process is able to handle negative floats by flipping the sign bit of each float's bit representation, and handles different magnitudes of floats by performing multiple iterations for each bit in the bit representation. The process sorts the floats as if they were integers, they retain their original floating point values.
